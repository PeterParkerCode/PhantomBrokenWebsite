Through pain, trial, and adversity that will only make more wiser as a human being. Those things that hurted us, will make you and me swing back for even more growth. "Slow success builds character, fast success builds ego." Every experince good and bad is a blessing. I always feel like the odd one out all the time, even when I tried to conform with the majority and tried to be accepted by others, it never feels right. I always looked at that like a curse, and felt like I'm crazy, weird and what not. I always try to look outside of myself and conform to someone elses style though never take the time to appreciate my style and use that to the fullest. At the same time not conforming is a gift, I'm happy to say that it saved me. I rather stand next to integrity and being truly myself than hiding under a fasade. I'm gonna face the music 🎵🎶 and overcome anything 🍃🌴.
