I've been thinking about how this world has been spiritually confused for a long time now and have been completely ignorant about it. Since we were born, we were taught to opreate with our egos and slowly ignore the things beyond this material world. We are more than just flesh and bones, our bodies is a temple, a church and a sacred place where our souls dwells, and yet we don't aknowledge this at all with our inner world as we put things within our bodies that poison us and it seems like we are disconnecting more with the kingdom of life. Life is beatiful and doesn't have to be suffering with all the agendas going on and majority of people being blind to it while turning against our spirituallity with God, nature, etc. We are living backwards sadly, while we are out of haramony with mother Earth the way we are going and the things these elites has in store for us to dumb us down more spiritually. It's time to sit back and think about what this system has been ignoring.
