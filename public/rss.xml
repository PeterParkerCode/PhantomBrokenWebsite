            <description>&lt;p&gt;Welp, my dream has finally came to a reality with a personal website and blog, without having to worry about censorship from any big platforms like Youtube who has been punishing my channel for a while back in 2021. This is a big moment for me and for you guys who have been with me. With the amount of creativity, freeing things that is now possible without the worry of big tech, this is an optimistic outlook! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>Divide and Conquer by the Elites FREE YOUR MIND| WHEN WILL WE COME TOGETHER?!	</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I knew I couldn&#x27;t kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But if I could get them to kill eachother...&amp;quot; - Zemo. SEE THROUGH THE ILLUSION AND THE AGENDA THAT IS BEING WAGED ON US. All of these hate crimes on the news and mainstream is to DIVIDE AND CONQUER US. They dont want us coming TOGETHER as a community and putting our differences to the side! If that were to happen, we&#x27;ll be too powerful than these higher ups and puppet on a string! They got us FIGHTING EACH OTHER instead of us fighting these &amp;quot;elites&amp;quot; whos doing this to us in the first place! See the repeated tactics they use against us. 9&#x2F;11, racially divide and hate towards Musilms creating a false flag to put us in control. Now with this pandemic, racial division again towards the black community, get us rally up, go against our neighbor, killing each other. Now more false flags on Asians and creating illusions by the media. We already know who is responsible for this whole &amp;quot;pandemic&amp;quot; in the first place! Research Event 201, these cover boys like Bill Gates, Fauci, Joe Biden, Trump etc. Is being controlled by the numbers, rituals, etc.! Hint: all roads lead to Rome. Like how in Captain America Civil War, the spilt of the Avengers was detrimental and came with consequences of that spilt. Fighting each other instead of looking at whos behind the scenes pulling the strings! They DON&#x27;T WANT US COMING TOGETHER! IF WE DO ITS OVER FOR THEM! THEY DEPEND ON US! WE HAVE THE POWER! Why you think they enslaved us? GovernMENT! Govern the MENTAL, THE MIND üß†. This is a phycological warfare that their doing on us! KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE POWER! Don&#x27;t fight your neighbor. He&#x27;s not the enemy. #FreeYourMind&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>The Illusion of Money</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://PhantomBroken.xyz/posts/illusionofmoney/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The more I reflect, thinking deep about it ever since this whole world changed, I&#x27;m now questioning within this system&#x27;s ego, my ego, and everyone elses. I see pass through it now, the way this world conditioned us within a tradition, something that the system raise and taught us to do since begining of schooling, which is to make money. But why though? The one thing out of everythung within this system that is keeping us stuck here, staying comfortable and not fight for whats going on in this Matrix. If you see pass it, money doesn&#x27;t exist, its the maya, an illusion that decieve us. We give it power and it distracts us, as it fuels this system. Question this to yourself, how come throughout our life, we never seen in public or outside in nature most of the times, something simple like a tree that grows fruits that you could pick, or a public gardan of vegetables that you can get and take it home with you to eat? Sounds logical that we should encounter these things as it was from mother nature. But no, its all behind a pay wall, cut off for people who needs it the most, how can the world be starving right now, if we can simply grow crops? Oh, but this inoculation is &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; for everyone to take, get free donuts, burgers, fries, alcohol, etc. But not free resources that mother nature gave us and is good for our health??? We are living in a backwards world. Everything we do within the system is backwards. And if you see it transparent even more, its crazy how anyone could make something right now, and get the whole world to value that, even if that thing in reality is nothing. Like a piece of paper, we get condition to think we should spend lifetime to get it. I mean look at crypto, its an illusion as well, just a number on a screen and we value that and chase a currency that you can&#x27;t even see. Why? Because we give it the power for it to survive like any illusion. Its an endless cycle that we gotta break. Like &amp;quot;In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.&amp;quot; , how THE FUCK THEY GOT US THINKING LIKE THAT when these elites built this matrix?!?!!?! WE NEED TO GET THEM OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW AND WE CAN!!! If everyone stopped participating in their game, everybody stopped paying taxes, to these criminals, that would be one step for humanity. And always hear &amp;quot;well how am I supposed to put food on the table without money?&amp;quot; THIS IS NOT THE WAY WE SUPPOSED TO BE LIVING IN THE FIRST PLACE! Well, I don&#x27;t know, how about all the free food from nature that we can eat right now, but they blocked it off. We aren&#x27;t independent at all, from our grandparents generation, being independent with EVERYTHING, like farms, foods that hasn&#x27;t been posioned, purified water, a COMMUNITY that WORKED TOGETHER, thats REAL value right there. How did we ended up like this where everything is corporate like Monsanto, blocked off needs that is already free within nature from the public. We gotta start thinking forwadly and find a way to come together before its too late. As we are still in the system and &amp;quot;need&amp;quot; money as it was designed this system, for now, I guess we gotta do what we do until that time comes and come together as a conscious which I hope it will. These agendas are not stopping and we will be left with no choice but to end they&#x27;re illusion that they&#x27;ve blinded us with. Stay strong... üß† &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been thinking about how this world has been spiritually confused for a long time now and have been completely ignorant about it. Since we were born, we were taught to opreate with our egos and slowly ignore the things beyond this material world. We are more than just flesh and bones, our bodies is a temple, a church and a sacred place where our souls dwells, and yet we don&#x27;t aknowledge this at all with our inner world as we put things within our bodies that poison us and it seems like we are disconnecting more with the kingdom of life. Life is beatiful and doesn&#x27;t have to be suffering with all the agendas going on and majority of people being blind to it while turning against our spirituallity with God, nature, etc. We are living backwards sadly, while we are out of haramony with mother Earth the way we are going and the things these elites has in store for us to dumb us down more spiritually. It&#x27;s time to sit back and think about what this system has been ignoring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is Emmet. And he was just like all of you. A face in the crowd, following the same instructions as you. He was so good at fitting in, no one ever saw him. And I owe you an apology, because I used to look down on people like that. Because it turns out Emmet had great ideas. And if they seemed weird, and kind of pointless, they actually came closer than anyone else to saving the universe. And now we have to finish what he started by making whatever weird thing pops into our heads. All of you have the ability inside of you to be a ground breaker. And I mean literally, break the ground! Peel off the pieces, tear apart your walls! Build things only you could build, defend yourselves!&amp;quot; ‚ö°üß† BELIEVE ! Free your mind ! Realest movie I&#x27;ve watched next to The Matrix and Inception. üíØ&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know you&#x27;re out there...I can feel you now. I know that you&#x27;re afraid. You&#x27;re afraid of us, you&#x27;re afraid of change...I don&#x27;t know the future...I didn&#x27;t come here to tell you how this is going to end, I came here to tell you how this is going to begin. Now, I&#x27;m going to hang up this phone, and I&#x27;m going to show these people what you don&#x27;t want them to see. I&#x27;m going to show them a world without you... a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world...where anything is possible. Where we go from there...is a choice I leave to you...&amp;quot; üî¥üíä Down the

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Through pain, trial, and adversity that will only make more wiser as a human being. Those things that hurted us, will make you and me swing back for even more growth. &amp;quot;Slow success builds character, fast success builds ego.&amp;quot; Every experince good and bad is a blessing. I always feel like the odd one out all the time, even when I tried to conform with the majority and tried to be accepted by others, it never feels right. I always looked at that like a curse, and felt like I&#x27;m crazy, weird and what not. I always try to look outside of myself and conform to someone elses style though never take the time to appreciate my style and use that to the fullest. At the same time not conforming is a gift, I&#x27;m happy to say that it saved me. I rather stand next to integrity and being truly myself than hiding under a fasade. I&#x27;m gonna face the music üéµüé∂ and overcome anything üçÉüå¥.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>Moving Forward, Heartbreak and healing</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <link>https://PhantomBroken.xyz/posts/movingforward/</link>
            <guid>https://PhantomBroken.xyz/posts/movingforward/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep running away from the things that I need to face, being attached on with the past and I can&#x27;t run and hide forever. Made a lot of mistakes with that connection that could&#x27;ve been something but it wasn&#x27;t mean&#x27;t to be. I&#x27;m still learning on how to move forward from it, which is still a challenge for me, reminsing about the times I had with her, mourning on what I lost. Though is it something that I really lost or that experince has already served its purpose and I returned it. That experince which had a lesson that I had to learn and still learning from. Theres things that is not in our control and others are in control. Its like a handful of cards that God, a higher power, universe etc. Gave us in life, that we have to accept, with the inevitable. Things don&#x27;t last forever family, friends, relationships all soon will have to come to an end at one point or another. The people in our lives and the foundation we build with them will soon, not have purpose anymore. Everything has purpose and we will have to move forward, return it and look towards a new sets of lessons in life that will have a new type of purpose. People change, the world is changing, and I have to come to accpetance that aye, she and I have, changed and even if it feels like we don&#x27;t know eachother anymore though thats life. And that makes me go into a deeper question, did I liked her for her, or the idea of her ü§î when it comes to my acceptance to what reailty is and not the fantasy and the things that are now the past&#x2F;memories? What is it that I can&#x27;t accept and move on from? Everything happens for a reason, I don&#x27;t believe in things being a &amp;quot;coincidence&amp;quot; and whoever made that word, must&#x27;ve been too much of a rational and logical minded person, I wouldn&#x27;t like to hang out with üòÇ. Everything down with synchronicities, angel numbers, you thinking about something and that thing pops up, going through a bad day and some good karma comes to you, can&#x27;t be a coincdence. This &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; of a connection could be a blessing in disguise that I am not seeing? Is me holding on to that branch of the past and not letting go of it, blocking those blessings? Who knows until you actually let go of that branch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
